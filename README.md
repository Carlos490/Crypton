# Crypton
Crypton is a programming language based on Python. This language can be used in various fields, including software development and object-oriented programming.

*System requirements:

Operating System: Windows

Character Set:

The following symbols are used in the Krypton programming language:

 **Letters and numbers**
 
 Capital letters: A-Z
 Lowercase letters: a-z
 Digits: 0-9

 **Special characters**

 Simple characters:`~`, `!`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `*`, `-`, `+`, `=`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `,`, `.`, `/`, `\`, `|`,`<`,`^`
 meaning:
 Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` etc.
 Separators: `,`, `.`, `;`
 Brackets: `()`, `{}`, `[]`
 Characters for strings**: `"`

 **Characters that are not used**

 The Krypton language does not support the following characters:

- $, @, `  `, ;, ?, ', _

# Syntax

This section describes the basic syntactic constructions of the Crypton language.

## Variables

To declare a variable as in Python, you do not need to specify the data type, just write the variable name, write the sign `=` and assign a value to the variable.

Example:

 x = 10

 and it turns out that this is the structure of the variable:

 [name] = [value]

 ## Types of data

 Crypton supports the following data types:

 Integers: 10, -5
 Real numbers: 3.14, -2.71
 Lines: "Hello, World!"
 Boolean values: true, false

 ## Operators

 **arithmetic operators**
 Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations.

 Addition (+): Adds two operands.

 a = 2 + 3 #a = 5

 Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.

 a = 8 - 5 #a = 3

 Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.

 a = 5  * 5 #a = 25

 Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second. The result is a real number.

 a = 20 / 5 #a = 4

 Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

 a = 2 ** 3 #a = 8

 mathematical root (//)The first operand is an exponent, for example, 2 is the square root and 3 is the cubic root.and the second operand is the main operand.

 a = 2 // 64 #a = 8

Division remainder (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

a = 50 % 4 #a = 2

**comparison operators**
Comparative operators are used to compare two values.

Equals (==): Checks whether two operands are equal.

a = (5 == 5) #a = true

Not equal to (!=): Checks if two operands are not equal.

a = (5 != 5) #a = true

Greater than (>): Checks whether the first operand is greater than the second.

a = (5 > 3) #a = true

Less than (<): Checks whether the first operand is smaller than the second.

a = (5 < 8) #a = true

Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.

a = (5 >= 5) #a = true

Less than or equal to (<=): Checks whether the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

a = (5 <= 8) #a = true

**logical operators**
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations.

And (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.

a = (true && false) #a = false

OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.

a = (true || false) #a = true

NOT (!): Inverts the Boolean value.

a = !true #a = false

**Bitwise operators**
Bitwise operators perform operations on bits of numbers.

Bitwise And (&): Performs bitwise And between two operands.

a = 5 & 3 #a = 1

Bitwise OR (|): Performs bitwise OR between two operands.

a = 5 | 3 #a = 7

Bitwise exclusive OR (^): Performs a bitwise exclusive OR between two operands.

a = 5 ^ 3 #a = 6

Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts the bits of the operand.

a = ~5 #a = -6

Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions.

a = 5 << 1 #a = 10

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions.

a = 5 >> 1 #a = 2

**Assignment operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.

a = 10

**Operations with strings**
String operations allow you to perform various operations with strings.

String concatenation (+/): The concatenation operation combines two or more strings into one.

a = "Hello" +/ "world" #a = "Hello world"

Repeating lines (*/): The line repetition operation allows you to repeat a line several times.

a = "Hello" */ 3 #a = HelloHelloHello

**Conditional operators**
Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of program execution depending on the fulfillment of conditions.

The if statement: The if statement executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.

if (temperature > 30) {
print ("Very hot");
}

The else operator: The else statement executes a block of code when the condition in if is false.

if (temperature > 30) {
print("Very hot");
} else {
 print("Temperature within normal limits");
}
